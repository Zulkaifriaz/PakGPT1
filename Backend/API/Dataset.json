Explanation 1: A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is served from the earth. Explanation 2: A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft. Explanation 3: A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle, which prevented it from moving, or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. Explanation 4: A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. Explanation 5: The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied. Illustrations(a)A cuts down a tree on Z's ground with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, the has committed theft. (b)A puts a bait for dogs in his pockets, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here if A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. (c)A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. (d)A being Z's servant and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft. (e)Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in 2's possession. It could not, therefore, be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. (f)A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it. A commits theft. (g)A finds a ring lying on the high-road, not in the possession of any person. A. by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property, (h)A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z. with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and soiling it when the toss is forgotten Here A. at the time of first moving the ring, commits the theft. (i)A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller, any debt for which the jewellers might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Y's hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly. (j)If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as security for his debt. he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. (k)Again, if A. having pawned his. watch to Z, takes it of Z's possession without Z's consent not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. (l)A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration Here A takes dishonestly: A has. therefore, committed theft. (m)A being on friendly terms with Z, goes to Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it. and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. (n)A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression. A has not committed theft. (o)A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives A valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. (p)A, in good faith believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of S's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. [ References: ( CHAPTER XVII TOPIC OF OFFENCES AGAINST PROPERTY SECTION 378 ) ]"

When extortion is robbery:Extortion is robbery if the offender, at the time of committing the extortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting that person in fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person, or to some other person, and by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing extorted. Explanation: The offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person in fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. Illustrations(a)A holds Z down, and fraudulently takes Z's money and jewels from Z's clothes, without Z's consent. Here A has committed theft, and in order to the committing of that theft, has voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to Z. A has therefore committed robbery. (b)A meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z's purse. 2, in consequence, surrender his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence. A has therefore committed robbery. (c)A meets Z and Z's child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to fling it down a precipice, unless Z delivers his purse. Z, in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to the child who is there present. A has, therefore, committed robbery on Z. (d)A obtains property from Z by saying Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us ten thousand rupees. This is extortion, punishable as such; but it is not robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of his child.

(b)A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent- Mere, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section.

            "Description": "Making a false document:A person is said to make a false document: First:Who dishonestly or fraudulently makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a document, or makes any mark denoting the execution of a document, with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document or part of a document was made, signed, sealed or executed by the authority of a person by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed or executed, or at a time at which he knows that it was not made, signed, seated or executed; or Secondly:Who, without lawful authority, dishonesty or fraudulently, by cancellation or otherwise, alters a document in any material part thereof, after it has been made or executed either by himself or by any other person, whether such person be living or dead at the time of such alteration; or Thirdly:Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute or later a document, knowing that such person by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication cannot, or that. by reason of deception practised upon him, he does not know the contents of the document or the nature of the alteration. Illustrations(a)A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,0OO, written by Z. A, in order to defraud E, adds a cipher to the 10,000 and makes the sum 10,000, intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter, A has committed forgery. (b)A, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. (c)A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently tills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery. (d)A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. (e)A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as. a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. (f) Z's will contains these words: I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C. A dishonestly scratches out B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. (g)A endorses a Government promissory-note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words Pay to Z or his order and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words Pay to Z or his order and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery. (h)A sells and conveys an estate to Z, A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate' executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, Intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery. (i)Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z, that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, Induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. (j)A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. (k)A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service. Explanation 1: A man's signature of his own name may amount to forgery. Illustrations(a)A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery. (b)A writes the word accepted on a piece of paper and sings it with Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intention, B is also guilty of forgery. (c)A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable, here A has committed forgery. (d)A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B after the seizure of the estate, in collusion With Z, executes a lease of the estate to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. S, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it. (e)A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory-note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates that note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition. Explanation 2: The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery. Illustration A draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery.
